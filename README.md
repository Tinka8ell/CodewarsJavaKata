## Longest Slide Down A Pyramid
I am particularly proud of my version of [LongestSlideDown](/src/main/java/LongestSlideDown.java)
as it had to be optimal for very high pyramids!

## Befunge Interpreter
I had fun with the [Befunge Interpreter](/src/main/java/BefungeInterpreter.java).  
It was a wierd experience to get my head around, but fun to code!

## Binomial Expansion
I had fun with the [Binomial Expansion](/src/main/java/KataSolution.java).  
Most difficult was doing the vector multiplication and resolution, 
but the second was getting the output format right !!! 

## Simple Assembler
These one is multipart.  It starts [simple](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58e24788e24ddee28e000053),
but there's a [second part](https://www.codewars.com/kata/assembler-interpreter-part-ii/),
which sounds more challenging!
So we start with the [simple assembler](/src/main/java/SimpleAssembler.java).
